                during
                their exile and sages like Garageshwara Muni who did their penance here. A fully functional cowshed
                (Goshala) with cows and required equipment is available at Datta Dhaama. Taking Dr. Sri Lakshmi Srinivas
                Guruji’s gracious advice many people have been rendering different kinds of service to the cows (Go

                <div class="paragraph">Cow is a very important animal. One Hindu goddess, Bhoomi (भुमि), is usually
                    shown in
                    the form of a cow. She represents the Earth.

                    In the Vedas, the oldest of the Hindu scriptures, the cow is associated with Aditi, the mother of
                    all
                    the gods.

                    Every body part of a cow symbolizes some venerable aspect as detailed below:
                    • Legs symbolize four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharvana),
                    • Teats symbolize four puruṣārthas (human pursuits) namely Dharma (righteousness), Artha (material
                    wealth), Kama(desire) and Moksha (freedom).
                    • Horns symbolize the Gods,
                    • Face symbolizes the Sun and Moon,
                    • Shoulders symbolize Agni devatā, the god of fire.

                    Garuda Purana, Upanishads, Jyothisha Shastra, Brahmanda Purana and many scriptures have stressed on
                    the
                    many benefits of GoSeva (Serving the Cow). The cow is considered the most holy animal as it has all
                    the
                    365 Gods, 9 Grahas, 12 Rashis & 27 Nakshatras residing in it. Even Lord Sri Krishna has described
                    GoSeva
                    in great detail in Brindavana. Scriptures also mention that Go Daana (donating a cow) is equivalent
                    to
                    performing an Ashwamedha Yagna.

                    We all celebrate our birthdays and anniversaries in a grand way by inviting many guests but are not
                    sure
                    how many of these guests will actually bless you. Most of the times these guests will discuss how
                    bad
                    the food at your party was. Instead by doing GoSeva on these special days in your life you avail
                    many
                    benefits and your prayers read God directly and you receive divine blessings.

                    It is proven that Cow’s Urine & Cowdung has steroids and antibodies. People in olden days already
                    knew
                    this fact and have used this extensively to maintain health, keep their homes free of pests and this
                    was
                    also used as a great fertilizer.

                    Go Seva is best when done in the morning during Sunrise. However it may be done before Sunset as
                    well.

                            way to Yama’s abode. They are Yamya, Souri, Nagendra, Gandharva, Shailagama, Krouncha,

                            Vahubhiti. In between the cities named Vichitra & Vahvapada, the river Vaitarani which is a
                            terrible river made of blood and guarded by fierce flesh eating birds has to be crossed. By
                            donating a cow a boat will be provided to safely cross this river.

                            In case a person has no children or if there is any uncertainty if Go Daana will be done by

                            The method specified in the scriptures is the Cowherd (Go Paalaka) should hold the tip of

        <h1>About Datta Dhaama <span style="color: #80a71d;">Goshala</span></h1>
        <p>Datta Dhaama is an ashram which is a sprawling 8 acre piece of land that was inhabited by the Pandavas during
            their exile and sages like Garageshwara Muni who did their penance here. Since this land was inhabited by
            the Pandavas and sages, Datta Dhaama exudes an atmosphere of peace, tranquility and spiritual bliss.

            Datta Dhaama is managed by Sri Shirdi Sai Biksha Kendra, a social service organisation under the divine
            guidance and leadership of "Mudra Ratna" "Mudra Brahma" Dr. Sri Lakshmi Srinivas Guruji.

            A fully functional cowshed (Goshala) with cows and required equipment is available at Datta Dhaama. Taking
            Sri Guruji’s gracious advice many people have been rendering different kinds of service to the cows (Go
            Seva) to get rid of their problems & illnesses with great results and success. Datta Dhaama is located at
            Garageshwarapura, Guddemarenahalli, Magadi Taluk, Ramanagar District, Karnataka, India.</p>
